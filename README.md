## What

After 4 years of having multiple crappy template-based versions of my personal website I decided this time will be different and built exactly what I wanted from scratch.

This is a [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) app that includes a lot of nice and shiny stuff.

A detailed description of the project can be found on [the website itself](https://fivepointseven.com/work/my-website).

Feel free to go through the code and see what's up :)
