## What is ExpressX?

Over the last couple years Iâ€™ve built quite a few applications on top of Express.js.  
Express is a great framework for building Node web apps, but the more I used it, the more I found
myself setting up lots and lots of boilerplate every time.  
  
In an average Express project I would normally have a build setup to take care of styles, transpilation,
frontend bundling, live reloading (which is tough to set up for non-frontend parts of an application), etc.  
But itâ€™s not the only part that needs a lot of boilerplate. Inside of the actual application thereâ€™s also a
view engine setup, i18n, body parsing, security, compression, HTTP/2...  
Every time youâ€™re working on an Express app, you need to spend time setting these up. I got really annoyed
doing it over and over again and decided to build something to fix it. And thus, ExpressX was born!

## So what the hell is it?

Itâ€™s a build system. Essentially. It is a little bit opinionated, but I believe the opinions are quite reasonable
and it removes a whole lot of headacge when building Express apps. Hereâ€™s the full list of things ExpressX
takes care of for you:

### Backend

*   ES6/7/Next (Babelâ€™s Ë®stage-3Ë® preset)
*   Flow types handling
*   HTTP/2 support
*   Proper live reload (including server side changes)
*   Body parsing
*   Handlebars setup
*   I18n setup
*   Helmet for security
*   Gzip compression

### Styles

*   SCSS compilation
*   Autoprefixing
*   Minification in production

### Frontend

*   Webpack bundling
*   webpack-dev-middleware support
*   Hot Module Replacement support

### Misc

*   Sweet error reporting from Babel/Webpack/Sass
*   Clean console output
*   SPEED

Wow, thatâ€™s quite a few features.

## How it works?

Thereâ€™s a few stages that happen when you run an app with ExpressX.

*   Babel transpilation runs on your main code
*   Style compilation runs
*   Webpack runs no your frontend code
*   Static assets are copied over to the build directory
*   Static cleanup (we donâ€™t want Sass in public folder)
*   Child process starts
*   Dev file watch starts

### Child process?

Yes, child process ðŸ˜ƒ. This is what allows live reload when backend code is changed.
The way itâ€™s set up is shamelessly stolen inspired by how Next.js does it. ExpressX starts your app in a
child process that it can watch for crashes and stop/restart when the change happens.

## How to use it?

To get started, install ExpressX module globally, create a new folder and run `expressx init` inside of that folder.
ExpressX will set up a simple project and install the dependencies. After that you can just run ` npm start` and youâ€™re set to go.

### Dependency Injection

Thereâ€™s one thing you need to keep in mind, which is the way your app is set up in app.js.
It needs to export a function that takes an app argument which is a standard Express app object.

```js
import index from './routes/index';

export default (app) => {
	// "app" is an express application instance
	// Do your setup here
	app.use('/', routes);

	return app; // Important, return "app" in the end
}
```

This is used for setting up all of the Express boilerplate like views, HTTP/2, etc.

## Config

If you want to override some default in ExpressX, you can do so via `expressx.config.js` file in the root of your
application. Hereâ€™s the structure of the file:

```js
module.exports = {
	babel: {
		ignore: [],
		sourceMaps: 'inline',
		presets: 'expressx/babel/server',
	},
	http2: false, // { key, cert }
	port: 3000,
	poweredByHeader: 'ExpressX', // string | false
	errorHandling: true,
	i18n: {
		locales: ['en'],
		cookie: 'locale',
		path: 'locales',
		objectNotation: true,
	},
	hbs: {
		views: 'views',
		partials: 'views/partials',
		layouts: 'views/layouts',
		defaultLayout: 'views/layouts/default',
	},
	staticFolder: 'public',
	autoprefixer: {
		grid: true,
	},
	helmet: null, // helmet.js options
	styles: ['public/styles/styles.scss'],
	stylesOut: 'public/css',
	webpackMode: 'direct', // "direct" | "middleware"
	webpack: config => config,
	webpackDevMiddleware: {
		publicPath: '/js/',
	},
	disableWebpack: false,
	watchmanIgnore: [],
	debugPort: 5858,
}
```

This file does not get transpiled, so you need to use `module.exports`.

### Conclusion

Since I built ExpressX, the amount of time I spend on setting things up is pretty much zero which
speeds up total development time quite a bit. If you build Express applications frequently,
I encourage you to try it out. Or you can even [contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/rdev/expressx) if you
want to add/change/fix something.
